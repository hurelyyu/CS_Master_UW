UW Tacoma 2016 Spring TCSS 555 Project: Facebook Data predict gender agegroup and personality 
With the appearance of the social network, more and more people like to share their own information on the website. Meanwhile, researchers are becoming more interested in mining this data for using the result in personalized information access services, recommend systems, tailored advertisements and other applications that can benefit form personalization. This project is aim to building a system to predict the age group, gender and personality (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism) of Facebook users automatically when given their personal profile such as status updates, profile pictures and “likes” information. By using different Machine Learning techniques we are able to build up different model for prediction on different purpose. We separate image, text for different approach in order to increase overall accuracy. Along with different machine learning models we used many libraries focused on image and text processing, such as openCV and NLTK language toolkit. We will get into details for these techniques in the following sections.

Algorithm in use:
KNN, SVD, SVM, PCA, Neural Network, Naive Bayes

Library in use:
OpenCV, Oxfore, LIWC, NLTK, Sklearn
